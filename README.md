# FENDfinalproj
this is my final project for the front end web developer nanodegree with Udacity. Combining all my skills into one huge project is the task at hand. 

after combining all techniques we have our final project and a nice little travel app created!

To get starter download the files and get your enviroment set up (express, node, and other npm scripts needed for this project).

Then Npm start on localhost:8800 to get files to populate on your browser. 

This project we used HTML, CSS/SASS, Vanilla JS and js libraries. By combining these tools we built a travel app that could be used to project weather using the Darkwebsky API, finding the locations by using Geonames API and pulling in images using the Pixaby API. By setting up get/post routes in our server.js we could create a app.js file to pull in the info and update our UI with the information needed for the travel app.

So go ahead, npm start this project up and get to get it running and voila! travel app!
